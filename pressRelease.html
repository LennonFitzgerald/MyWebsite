   <h4>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h4>
    <p>Lennon Fitzgerald Debuts Her Highly Anticipated Album Before I’m Too Old on January 15 <br>
        
        Brisbane-based musician and artist Lennon Fitzgerald is poised to make her mark on the music world with the release of her debut album, Before I’m Too Old, available on all major streaming platforms starting January 15.<br>
        
        Blending elements of indie rock, shoegaze, and dream pop with heartfelt lyrics, Before I’m Too Old’ presents a raw and authentic exploration of life’s challenges, resilience, and the enduring pursuit of dreams. <br>
        <br>
        Drawing from deeply personal experiences with loss, chronic illness, and self-reclamation, the album resonates with listeners by offering both solace and inspiration. <br>
        
        “This album represents my belief that there’s no time limit on pursuing your dreams,” says Lennon. “For years, I was too unwell to release this album, and it felt like time was slipping away. <br> 
        Before I’m Too Old is both a reflection of that struggle and a declaration of perseverance. It’s about reclaiming my voice and proving that it’s never too late to follow your passions.” <br>
        <br>
        Featured Tracks: <br>
        • “It’s My Life” – A powerful anthem written during a time when Lennon felt trapped in an unfulfilling job. “By industry standards at the time, I wasn’t thin enough or confident enough to break into music. <br>
        I wrote this ballad as an outlet for my frustration and longing for purpose,” Lennon shares. “I finished the song 12 years later, reflecting on my soul screaming for fulfillment, even when I had opportunities in Australia’s richest company.”<br>
        <br>
        • “Catch the Sand” – A poignant track inspired by the journey of losing her mother to cancer. Using vivid imagery, Lennon captures the heartache of trying to hold onto moments and feelings that inevitably slip away, like sand through her fingers.<br>
        <br>
        • “A Good Time” – This song speaks to the mundane and often painful realities of life, as well as the longing to numb that pain or experience joy. On a deeper level, it explores the yearning for an easier life and the frustration of its seeming inaccessibility.<br>
        
        In the lead-up to the album release, Lennon will offer fans exclusive behind-the-scenes content on social media, along with announcements about live performances and related events such as virtual listening parties and collaborations with other artists.<br>
        <br>
        Stream Before I’m Too Old on Spotify, Apple Music, and all leading platforms starting January 15, and join Lennon Fitzgerald on her journey to share authentic, meaningful music with the world.<br>
