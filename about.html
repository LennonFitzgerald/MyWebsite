    <h2>About Lennon Fitzgerald</h2>
    <p>
        Writing music since the age of 12, Lennon Fitzgerald is a passionate lyricist, songwriter, and music producer.<br> 
        She has been obsessed with Kurt Cobain since youth, which instilled in her the goal to write her music by herself. <br>
        She still composes on the same second-hand Casio keyboard gifted to her as a teenager, famously repairing it with chewing gum in 2012. <br>
        Lennonâ€™s deep connection to her craft and her journey of self-expression make her a unique voice in the indie music scene.<br>
